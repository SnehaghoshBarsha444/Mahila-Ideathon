# Women Entrepreneurs Skill-Building Platform

## Overview
Women in rural and semi-urban areas face significant barriers in accessing holistic skill-building programs crucial for entrepreneurship. Existing vocational training often lacks essential business skills like financial management, digital marketing, and leadership. Social constraints, limited digital access, and mobility challenges further hinder their growth.

This project aims to develop an innovative, scalable, and inclusive skill-building model that integrates vocational training with entrepreneurial and soft skills. The platform will be accessible through both digital and offline methods, addressing gender-specific barriers while providing mentorship, peer networks, and market linkages.

## How It Solves the Problem
We propose a **hybrid skill-building platform** that integrates:
- **Vocational Training** ‚Äì Skill-based courses tailored to local industries.
- **Entrepreneurship Education** ‚Äì Business planning, financial literacy, and digital marketing.
- **Soft Skills Development** ‚Äì Communication, negotiation, and leadership training.
- **Mobile-Friendly Learning** ‚Äì Progressive Web App (PWA) for low-data usage.
- **AI-Powered Mentorship** ‚Äì 24/7 chatbot assistance for continuous learning.
- **Community Engagement** ‚Äì Peer networks and mentorship programs.

This approach ensures accessibility, enhances confidence, and empowers women to establish and expand successful businesses, fostering economic independence and community development.

## Impact Metrics
To measure success, we will track:
- **Enrollment & Completion Rates** ‚Äì Participation and course completion.
- **New Business Creation & Growth** ‚Äì Startups and scaling of women-led businesses.
